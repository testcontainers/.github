## What is Testcontainers?

Testcontainers is a testing library
that provides easy and lightweight APIs for bootstrapping integration tests with real services 
wrapped in Docker containers. 
Using Testcontainers, you can write tests talking to the same type of services you use in production
without mocks or in-memory services.

## Implementations

Testcontainers is available for the following languages:

* [Testcontainers for .NET](https://dotnet.testcontainers.org/)
* [Testcontainers for Go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/)
* [Testcontainers for Java](https://java.testcontainers.org/)
* [Testcontainers for Node.js](https://node.testcontainers.org/)

## Modules Catalog

Testcontainers offers modules with preconfigured implementations for popular services 
such as databases, message brokers, and more. 
Find the full list of modules in the [Testcontainers Module Catalog](https://testcontainers.com/modules/). 
If you own a Testcontainers module implementation, please submit it to the catalog by creating a pull request to [this repository](https://github.com/testcontainers/community-module-registry).
